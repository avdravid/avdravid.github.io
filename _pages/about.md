<hr>
* Hi! I am a PhD student at Berkeley AI Research, advised by [Prof. Alexei Efros](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/). I am interested in deep learning problems and applications to computer vision. My research is supported by the DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellowship.
* I graduated from Northwestern with a BS in Computer Science. I have had the pleasure of working with: [Prof. Aggelos Katsaggelos](https://ivpl.northwestern.edu/) (Northwestern Image+Video Processing Lab),  [Prof. Pietro Perona](https://www.vision.caltech.edu/team/) (Caltech Vision Group), [Jennifer J. Sun](http://jenjsun.com/) (Incoming Faculty at Cornell), [Vibhav Vineet, Neel Joshi](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/vision/people/) (MSR Computer Vision Group).
